## process overview

1.	Data Collection and Preparation:
 	Raw sales data for 2022 was provided as the basis for this project.
	Initial Check: The data was examined for any errors such as duplicates or blank values, which could lead to inaccuracies during visualization.
2.	Data Cleaning:
	Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate entries to ensure accurate analysis.
  Spell Mistakes: Detected and corrected spelling errors within the dataset, especially in key columns like product names and categories.
	Column Refinement: Used Excel formulas to separate day, month, and year values where needed, ensuring date consistency. Unnecessary columns were deleted to                        maintain focus on relevant information.
3.	Data Processing:
	With a clean dataset, I began organizing the data by identifying key metrics that would be valuable for the business owner. These metrics included overall      sales, product-wise performance, and monthly sales trends.
4.	Visualization:
	Created pivot tables and charts to present the data insights visually.
	Developed visual answers to predicted questions such as:
Which products performed best and worst in 2022?
	What were the peak and slow sales months?
	How did sales compare across different product categories?
	These insights were key to guiding future decisions for inventory and promotions.
5.	Final Dashboard:
	Assembled all insights into an interactive, user-friendly dashboard.
	Imported slicers to enable easy filtering of data by product, month, and other relevant factors.
	Created connections between the slicers and charts to allow dynamic exploration of data.
